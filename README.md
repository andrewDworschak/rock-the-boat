### Functionality
- **Damping**: Control the amount of friction force the boat experiences.
- **Density**: Control the density of the boat relative to the water.
- **Draw**: Draw a new boat hull.
- **Power**: Control the strength of a perturbation.
- **Perturb**: Nudge the boat with a specified power.
